<h3><u>About me/ my skills:</u></h3>

Hi, I am Charlie.  I know many things about computers and development of programs, I have created many projects in the past including small games, bots, servers and plugins as well as random programs to do smaller tasks or to test my skills.

I know Java, Scala and python and am very confident in these languages, I also know HTML CSS and JavaScript, which I used to make this site, and a few other languages however I am not as confident in these as they require work still before I know them well.

I also have experience in AWS (Amazon Web Services) as I have a server that I use for my test programs and to store info on, and I also created a website for work experience back in year 10 all by my self.  It is still operational and can be found at <a href = "http://www.smartstaffltd.co.uk" target="_blank" style="color:#303030;">SmartStaffLTD.co.uk</a> if you want to look.

I also have many awards from school, (mainly for math) including a ‘best in school’ at a mathematics competition, platinum award (of which only 2 where ever awarded across the whole school while I was there) and I even took the further mathematics GCSE a year early and passed with a grade A! 

I also managed to complete the 20hr coding challenge in computing classes in just 5 hours!  This shows that I am a fast worker and will be able to give you your program as quickly as possible.


<h3><u>Why you should choose me:</u></h3>
I love coding and will be able to make a program that runs smoothly.  I am also a fast coder, however don't let this deter you and make you think its going to be really sloppy and full of bugs, as I seem to have a keen eye for finding them and once I find one I need to fix it ASAP or it will really bug me.  (Sorry for the very bad pun).

I also love learning new skills and am in the process of learning many new languages, so even if I haven't listed the language you would like me to use above, it may just be because its one I am still learning but could still do some work for you in.  I also work cheap and will keep to our agreement of what you want coded and the price it will cost.


<h3><u>Pricing:</u></h3>
The pricing depends on what you need to be programmed.  If its a large, complex program then it is going to cost more than if its just a small program I could make in an hour.  If you would like to get an idea of how much your task will cost, then just get in contact with me and I will let you know.

I don't charge too much for my services and am willing to take offers, if they are reasonable.  I accept the payments after I have finished writing the program, that way in the unlikely event something major happens in my life and I cant complete it on time, I will be able to give you a discounted price.
