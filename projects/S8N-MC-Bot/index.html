        <a href="https://discord.gg/s8nMC" target="_blank">S8N MC Bot</a> was a bot I worked on with a small team which we developed for a
        discord server containing thousands of users owned by <a href="https://twitter.com/s8n" target="_blank">@s8n</a>.<br>
        Our bot had many functionalities, such as greeting users when they join, logging events that happen in the server,
        managing users levels as they chatted, and many other features too.  This meant we had to build it to be able to
        run smoothly while receiving thousands of requests per hour.<br>
        <br>
        The bot was developed when the server had around 2000 users in it before the Minecraft server was open, meaning
        our bot was running when s8n tweeted on his main account to announce the <a href="" target="_blank">Discord and Minecraft server</a>.
        During the first 10 minutes, we had [x] people join the Discord, each of which we had to greet, assign a role to, and log it as an event.
        On top of this, we had many more users using commands and gaining xp from talking in the text channels.  Our bot ran though this
        with [no|minimal|major] downtime.<br>
        <br>
        Overall, our user count in the server went from about 2100 to [xx] in 24 hours.
