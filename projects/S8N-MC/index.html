        <a href="https://discord.gg/s8nMC" target="_blank">S8N MC</a> is a MineCraft and Discord server created by <a href="https://twitter.com/s8n" target="_blank">@s8n</a>.
        I helped work on both the MineCraft server as a SysAdmin as well as on the Discord bot in the Discord server.<br>



        //TODO: redo

        discord server containing thousands of users <br>
        Our bot had many functionalities, such as greeting users when they join, logging events that happen in the server,
        managing users levels as they chatted, generating user profiles, and many other features too.  This meant we had to build it to be able to
        run smoothly while receiving thousands of requests per hour.<br>
