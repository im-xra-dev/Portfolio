    Hi, I am Charlie, a Full Stack developer with experience in Desktop applications, Web Development and creating bots.<br>
    <br>
    I am experienced in developing with a range of languages, libraries and APIs which allows me to build top quality applications that run smoothly, and can handle a large user-base.<br>
    I also fully test all the code that I write in order to ensure that my applications do not encounter any unexpected behaviour.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    The languages that I use to build programs with include Java, Python and JavaScript/Node JS.  As well as this I am experienced in designing UI for websites with HTML/CSS.<br>
    I additionally have experience with both SQL and NoSQL Databases, and can set up servers to host the backend due to my experience with AWS and Linux.
